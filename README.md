## About

```discord-router``` is a Node.js module for discord.js that allows you to easly create dynamic and stunning interfaces with embeds for your Discord bot.
- Lightweight
- Easy to use
- CLI

## Get started

### Installation
> By this tutorial, we assume that you already installed Node.js and already started with discord.js.
<br>If not, refer to [Node.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/tree/stable#installation) and [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/tree/stable#installation) installation guides.

**Node.js 10.0.0 or newer and discord.js 11.5.1 or newer is required**
      
    npm install discord-router
    
### Example
Assuming that you already made your index file, lets start !
```node
const Discord = require('discord.js')
const Router = require('discord-router')
const client = new Discord.Client()

Router.setRoutes(require('./routes'))
Router.setClient(client)

client.on('message', message => {
    if (message.author.bot) return

    if (message.content === "init") {
        Router.send('ping', message.author, message.channel)
    }
})

client.on('ready', () => {
    console.log('Ready to guide them embeds !')
})

client.login('PRIVATE_DISCORD_TOKEN')
```

Now, create a file named ``routes.js``, it will contains settings for your different routes.
For each route, define a ``name``, a ``path`` and the location to your ``template``.
```node
module.exports = [
    {
        name: "ping",
        path: "Path of ping",
        template: require('./templates/ping.js')
    },
    {
        name: "pong",
        path: "Path of pong",
        template: require('./templates/pong.js')
    }
]
```

And now, create your templates in a directory called ``templates``.
Each templates needs a ``content`` and one or multiple ``actions`` with an ``emoji`` and a route name to navigate ``to``.
```node
module.exports = {
    content: "It's a ping!",
    actions: [
        {
            emoji: "üèì",
            to: "pong"
        }
    ]
}
```

Now, we will create a second template for the ``pong`` route.

### Result
Let's have a fun ping-pong game with your new buddy !<br>
